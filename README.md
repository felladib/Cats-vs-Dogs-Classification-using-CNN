# Cats-vs-Dogs-Classification-using-CNN
Cats vs Dogs classification is a fundamental Deep Learning project for beginners. If you want to start your Deep Learning Journey with Python Keras, you must work on this elementary project.

In this Keras project, we will discover how to build and train a convolution neural network for classifying images of Cats and Dogs.
# Cats vs Dogs Classification

This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset used is from the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).
